📋 Project Description
This is a simple Workout Time Planner that calculates the user's BMI from weight (kg) and height (feet), suggests a workout duration, and gives basic diet advice. Additionally, the app now recommends whether the user should work out at home or go to the gym based on their BMI.

🧠 BMI Categories and Recommendations
BMI Range	Category	Workout Suggestion	Gym/Home Recommendation
< 18.5	Underweight	30 mins light workout	Work out at home with bodyweight exercises
18.5 - 24.9	Normal	45 mins balanced workout	Work out at the gym (strength + cardio)
25.0 - 29.9	Overweight	60 mins moderate workout	Work out at the gym (weight management)
≥ 30.0	Obese	60–90 mins cardio & strength	Work out at the gym (supervised workouts)
